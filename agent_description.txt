This agent retrieves real-time weather (temp, humidity, wind) for a location via OpenWeatherMap, then computes a fire-risk class (L, M, H, VH). Next, it searches the internet for active fire reports; if none or risk remains moderate, it fetches Sentinel-2 imagery to detect hotspots (elevating risk if found). Finally, if the risk is High or Very High, the agent dispatches a drone to capture aerial images.
